        About Theta Tau
        </h1>
        <p id="about-blurb">
          Theta Tau is a Co-Ed Professional Engineering Fraternity, originally named the Society of Hammer and Tongs, was founded on October 15, 1904 in Minneapolis. The founders Erich J. Schrader, Elwin L. Vinal, William M. Lewis, and Isaac B. Hanks were all mining engineering students at the University of Minnesota. These four founders based Theta Tau upon three main principles: community service, brotherhood, and professional development.
