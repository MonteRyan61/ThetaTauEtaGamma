          Theta Tau is a Co-Ed Professional Engineering Fraternity, originally named the Society of Hammer and Tongs, was founded on October 15, 1904 in Minneapolis. The founders Erich J. Schrader, Elwin L. Vinal, William M. Lewis, and Isaac B. Hanks were all mining engineering students at the University of Minnesota. These four founders based Theta Tau upon three main principles: community service, brotherhood, and professional development.

              In April of 1997, eight bright, determined and like-minded individuals set out to establish the Eta Gamma chapter of Theta Tau at CU Boulder. Their courage to start a new chapter speaks volumes about who they were, and we are honored to follow in their footsteps.
              <br><br>Theta Tau is a co-ed professional engineering fraternity with a purpose to develop and maintain a high standard of professional interest among its members and to unite them in a strong bond of fraternal fellowship.
              <br><br>Our Fraternity represents a group of diverse people who always strive for the highest level of excellence, as our founders intended. Shared goals and interests in areas of engineering, brotherhood, and service hold our chapter together and define who are we
